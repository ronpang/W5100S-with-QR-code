W5100S with QR code to adafruit IO
A Project has planned to use WizFi360-EVB-PICO with barcode reader . It used circuitpython and python codes to create this application. 

By providing a strong connection service and a new way to develop my application using WIZnet's solution, I had used Ethernet rather than WiFi to work on this application develop.
